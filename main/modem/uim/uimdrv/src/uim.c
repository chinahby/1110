                   the ATR bytes, signal's pending in the UIM TCB etc.
                   Changed the timeout_logging function to be called every where
                   so that we will do a power down or reset before logging.
                   Added code to handle 27.11.2.6 (WWT exceeded during PPS phase)
                   when multiple voltage class support is turned on.
12/16/04   jk      Merged changes for Orange support from mainline
12/14/04   pv      Added check to make sure that cmd_ptr is not null
                   before invoking uim_process_card_response.
12/06/04   pv      Added code to log UIM driver/server status when a timeout occurs
11/22/04   jk      Added 3GPD support for CDMA service table check
11/21/04   wli     Dual slot merge and debug.
11/16/04   pv      Added code to power down the interface when a currupted
                   ATR is received and do not try a higher voltage if we
                   already have the voltage information from the ATR.
                   Cr. No. 51127

09/20/04   pv      Brought in support for dual slots when powering down the
                   interfaces because of maxing error count.  Also added
                   code to signal the requestor when the current command fails.
                   The new code checks if there is a next voltage class available
                   upon max rx break error and tries it instead of powering down.
09/01/04   jk      Added support for HRPD AN Authentication services in R-UIM
09/01/04   ck      Added support for CPHS files
09/01/04   ck      Added support for CSIM
08/30/04   pv      Take the protocol information from UIM variables instead of
                   requesting GSDI for the protocol information.
08/10/04   pv      Added more messages to debug timeout and cleared the error
                   flags conditionally.

06/16/04   ck      Merged support for including protocol information in link
                   established message to GSDI from Cheetah branch
06/16/04   wli     Added ORANGE DF and its related EFs.
06/11/04   wli     Added EFs to support KDDI.
06/03/04   ts      Fixed featurization misspelling -
                   FEATURE_UIM_SUPPORT_DUAL_SLOT(S).
05/17/04   ck      Moved the featurizations around to send DF presence info
                   for single slot in GSDI Link est message
                   Also added ATR information in GSDI Link est
                   Added support to indicate whether the command was transacted
                   with the card.
04/16/04   ts      Fixed problems with error condition processing due to bad
                   merge.
04/08/04   wli     Featurize for non-gsdi targets.
03/26/04   ts      Added support to bring down the interface for excessive null
                   procedure bytes.

                   receive error conditions.
03/15/04   ts      Change the instruction class to GSM if card times out on
                   USIM instruction class.
03/12/04   ck      Removed the check for uim_powerdown while starting and
                   stopping the clock for dual slots.
03/08/04   ck      Added suport to read specific CDMA files from both the slots.
02/25/04   ck      Fixed a bug where the second slot was also initialized when
                   the first slot timed out after initial power up.
02/18/04   ck      Fixed Lint errors.
02/09/04   ck      Changed the if-else to switch stmt in the function uim_get_
                   slot() for certain GSM files.

                   irrespective of operational slot.
02/03/04   ts      Added a check to wait until the power down vote allows power
                   down or when power down is required until powering down the
01/29/03   ck      Removed UIM_MC from the CDMA traffic channel mask
                   Cleared CMD_Q_SIG from the I-mask upon cmd completion before
                   processing the power up of the second slot. Clearing the sig
                   after the function uim_process_slot_power_up resulted in
                   processing of another command before completing the power up.
01/21/04   ck      Fixed a bug where the poll timer was not being reset when a
                   91 xx (Fetch) was returned for a Status response.
12/19/03   jk      Added processing for R-UIM 3GPD Services.

12/04/03   wli     Added FEATURE_UIM_TOOLKIT feature switch around toolkit
                   related varibles.
12/04/03   ck      Added a feature to force the first instruction class as GSM
                   to be used for dual slot targets.
                   Modified the aggregation of bits in CDMA_TC and GW_TC.
11/04/03   ck      Ensured that the CMD_Q_SIG was added to the mask after the
                   processing of the PREF_SLOT_CHANGE_F command.
10/03/03   ck      Added support to stop the clock irrespective of the vote and
                   turn it ON only when needed to process commands.
                   Merged in the support to use the flag uim_atr_pps_done
09/17/03   ck      Added checks to make sure that PREF_SLOT_CHANGE command is
                   not rejected when the status for the slot specified in the
                   command header is invalid.
09/12/03   ck      Changed the polling architecture to make sure that the
                   interval between STATUS command is less than 30s while in
                   traffic channel even if there are other accesses to the card
                   Also, poll the card as soon we get an indication of the
                   traffic channel setup.
09/02/03   ck      Added support to set the CDMA directory present in the nvruim
                   structure for dual slots.
08/20/03   ck      Use the slot in the command for Invalidate and Rehabilitate
                   commands.
08/15/03   ck      Changes from code review.
08/14/03   ck      Added support for dual slots.
08/04/03   ck      Reset the poll timer when the POLL_TIMER_SIGNAL was set and
                   UIM status was CLK_OFF_S and the card in use was not a
                   pro-active card.
                   Included UIM_TC to the check for arriving at the poll timer
                   delay when in traffic channel.
07/09/03   ck      Initialized the overrun error flag to FALSE.
                   Fixed a comment line that threw up a warning.
                   Removed the featurization around the funtion uim_nv_init().
06/25/03   ck      Added check to make sure that we select the USIM ADF even
                   when we are in the second level DF under USIM ADF before
                   processing the AUTHENTICATE command.
06/19/03   ck      Moved the code that handles command error into a function and
                   added support to handle overrun error.
06/05/03   ck      Reset the curr_app data structure in the function
                   uim_reset_dir().
06/03/03   ck      Added support to reset the UIM based on the status rsp
                   UIM_INSTRN_CHANGE and UIM_CONVENTION_CHANGE.
05/18/03   wli     Fixed compilation error when GSM ACCESS feature turned on.
05/01/03   ck      Removed the featurization around forcefully voting off the
                   different power control bits upon receiving TASK STOP.
04/28/03   ts      Added support for multi-Voltage classes.
04/28/03   ts      Added support for T=1 protocol.
04/28/03   ck      Moved the powerdown processing code as the last check in the
                   uim_task function. This greatly improves the standby time as a
                   result of stopping the clock right after the command(poll) is
                   completed.
04/25/03   wli     Declaired temp_uim_aid that was missing.
04/24/03   ck      Fixed an issue with directory maintenace that was causing an
                   issue with selection of Telecom PBR following a failure in
                   selecting USIM PBR.
02/26/03   jk      Added UTIL and WIM functionality
03/14/03   ck      Added a check to see if the card is a pro-active card
                   before polling the card when the status is CLK_OFF_S.
03/04/03   ck      Added the function uim_get_enum_value_for_path.
02/13/03   wli     Changed to support GSTK.

11/21/02   ts      For 1x only builds, vote everyone off when receiving a task
                   stop.  Set status to ERR to ensure UIM does not power-up
                   after task stop.
11/15/02   ts      Ensure power down status indicates it is okay to power down when
                   powering down due to bad UIM link.
10/31/02   ts      Removed extraneous parenthesis in power down/clock stop
                   determination.
10/29/02   ck      Declared the boolean uim_atr_recd and use it to check if the
                   command count needs to be incremented for the internal
                   power up command so that the command is not tried again.
10/25/02   ck      Added support to indicate the poll error with a new status to
                   GSDI
10/24/02   ts      Added support for work waiting time
10/24/02   ts      Set command_in_progress to false when command times out.
10/14/02   ck      Report error for GSM ECC if one attempt fails.
10/11/02   ck      Added support for reading the first instruction class to be
                   used in the SELECT command from NV in the context of TMC.
10/02/02   ts      Wait for requests to be finished before powering down UIM
                   for task stop.  Acknowledge task stop after powering down.
10/02/02   ts      Changed the featurization around the GSDI interface.
09/20/02   ts      Set the cmd_ptr to NULL when finished processing the
                   command.
08/27/01   ck      Added support for multimode architecture to start and stop
                   the UIM task.
                   Added support for Multimode GSDI.
08/14/02   wli     Modified the feature defines around stop clock or power down.
07/25/02   ck      Modified the feature defines around polling while in idle
                   mode to be only applicable when the UIM is proactive.
                   Modified the input parameters to STATUS command for an
                   internal poll.
                   Fixed a path selection issue that did not include MF in the
                   path when just the AID was selected.
07/09/02   ck      Added support for AID selection by path.
                   Modified powerdown of UIM to be featurized out for USIM and
                   allowed for clock stop based on the return type.
05/21/02   plm     Removed conditional code for T_KOVU and T_MSM5200 for calling
                   tmc_task_start(). This code is not necessary for GSM or MSM5200
                   since they already redefine mc_task_start() to tmc_task_start()
                   in mc.h.
05/15/02   ts      Featurized else for clock stop code when toolkit is not
                   enabled.
05/01/02   ts      Need to set the poll timer with the new timer duration when
                   the duration changes between the proactive duration to the
                   traffic channel duration.
04/29/02   ck      Added UIM_USIM_SESSION to uim_ctl as default for USIM targets.
04/09/02   ck      Modified the #defines to implement Clock stop for USIM.
04/03/02   ts      Implemented polling control for Proactive commands.  Polling
                   duration depends on whether MC votes to keep the UIM power
                   on.  This indicates the phone is in the traffic channel.
                   Otherwise, the polling frequency is the Proactive frequency.
02/11/02   ts      Changed the code surrounding uim_get_file_path to include
                   processing for items (EFs) whose paths are defined by the
                   card.
02/01/02   ts      Process a new status from processing a UIM command.  The new
                   status indicates the card does not support 3V technology.
01/25/02   ts      Cleared the poll timer, poll timer signal and mask the poll
                   timer task signal from the UIM task to ensure the poll does
                   not happen when processing a command.
01/25/02   ts      Added support for Kovu.  Kovu is same as MSM5200.
01/22/02   ck      Added support for clock stop mode.
01/08/02   ck      Wrapped the uim_return_cdma_svc_availabililty function
                   call around the feature FEATURE_UIM_RUIM
12/18/01   ck      Added support to access GSM EFs when build for R-UIM and
                   modified the featurization around GSDI code.
                   Added support for EFs in DCS1800 DF.
13/12/01   ts      Cleaned out the last selected directory path when resetting
                   the UIM card.
12/13/01   ts      Added some comments and fixed format of code.
12/04/01   ts      Added support for UTK.
11/19/01   ts      Fixed a polling bug for USIM.
10/11/01   ck      Removed the featurization for DOG reporting for MSM5200.
                   Modified the path for EF HLPMN selector in USIM ADF.
                   Enhanced the SEEK interface to include path in the command
08/10/01   ck      Fixed the problem where the command header status was not
                   set to RECEIVED when the processing of the command had
                   begun.
                   Fixed the problem where the card was being reset even after
                   it was declared as faulty.
07/27/01   ts      Set the UIM_AUTH voter flag on startup so that the UIM stays
                   powered on until Auth gets initialized (reads call count).
07/23/01   ck      Added support for EF ECC,SPC STATUS and MAX_PRL.
                   Added a function to export the response to store esn_me.
                   Fixed a bug in which a second select to the same EF did not
                   fill the path to be selected array.
05/28/01   ck      Added support for R-UIM, GSM and USIM modules.
01/15/01   ck      Created module from AUTH module rev 1.5 from Common
                   archive.

FUNCTION UIM_REMOVE_COMMAND_FROM_UIM_CMD_Q

DESCRIPTION
  Checks to see if a pointer to a command is on the uim_cmd_q, and if it is,
  removes it.  This is not a function to be used widely, but is used if a
  a client (mmgsdi) has abandoned this command as a presumed failure, and
  wants to deallocate the memory associated with this command.  This procedure
  is used to prevent a corrupted uim_cmd_q in the event that mmgsdi deallocates
  a command which uim still intends to process.  It mostly will happen with
  bad UIM HW, where there is a reoccuring recovery scenario, and UIM and MMGSDI
  are having trouble keeping their states synched due to constant resets.
