                   recvd during throttling do not get passed on to call
                   objects at the end of throttling. There was no way to pass
                   on changes in serving system parameters to call objects
                   after throttling got ended.
09/03/04   ka      Added service throttling for HDR. Both HDR and MAIN throttling
                   is stopped if EVENT_SRV_CHANGED is generated due to other

07/07/04   ka      Fixed Lint errors.
07/06/04   ka      Throttling EVENT_SRV_CHANGED sent to clients in STATUS_SRV
                   or STATUS_LIMITED. First transition to SERVICE reported immed.
                   Subseqent change in SERVICE params reported in 2 secs interv.
                   If no change detected in SERVICE params for 2 secs or
                   transitioned out of SERVICE, we move out of throttling mode.

06/07/04   sj      Removed call to generate ph event standby sleep and wakeup.
05/27/04   ic      In cmss_client_cmd_proc() call cmss_client_cmd_err()
                   irrespective of whether error occured or not (client is
                   supposed to be always notified about command processing
                   status)
05/20/04   ic      Removed unnecessary comment
05/18/04   ic      In cmss_send_idle_digital_mode_event() copied current and
                   previous IDM from CM SS IDM object into CM SS object

                   Removed cmss_update_rssi() as it had been removed long ago
                   from Jaguar 4.X branch
                   Replaced calls to cmss_update_rssi() with calls to
                   cmss_report_rssi() so CM SS here behaves like on 4.X Jaguar
                   branch with respect to RSSI reporting.
04/22/04   ic      Defined CMSS_ECIO_VALUE_NO_SIGNAL / CMSS_IO_VALUE_NO_SIGNAL.
                   Used them to initialize ecio / hdr_ecio and io / hdr_io
                   fields in CM SS object.
04/19/04   ic      Added support for HDR Ec/Io & Io reporting.
