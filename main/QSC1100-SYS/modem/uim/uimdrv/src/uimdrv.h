FUNCTION UIM_SEND_COMMAND                          EXTERNALIZED FUNCTION

DESCRIPTION
  This function sets up the transfer of an APDU to the UIM.  This function
  starts the transfer, which, if all goes well, is finished by the
  uim_rx_isr.

DEPENDENCIES
  This function starts an APDU exchange.  The exchange can only happen after
  the ATR has been received and, optionally, after a PPS exchange.

RETURN VALUE
  None

SIDE EFFECTS
  The UIM driver will continue to send out the APDU.  All the stages of
  sending the APDU are handled by the UIM driver.  Then the driver expects
  the APDU response.  Some commands solicit a GET_RESPONSE or a FETCH command
  to be sent after the APDU.

FUNCTION UIM_ENABLE_VREG_LPM

DESCRIPTION
  The PMIC has the ability to put the different Voltage Regulators into
  a Low Power Mode.  The Regulator will go in and out of LPM based on
  the TCXO state of TCXO.  When in TXCO Shutdown, VREG (R)UIM is put
  into an LPM Mode. When TCXO is enabled, VREG (R)UIM is pulled out
  of LPM Mode.

  Going in an out of LPM is controlled by the PMIC.

  The UIM Drivers will need to ensure that the PMIC is notified that LPM
  mode is allowed for VREG (R)UIM.

  The UIM will not have to take VREG (R)UIM out of LPM

DEPENDENCIES
  Prior to calling this function, we must ensure from a system perspective
  that the following functions have been called.

  1) rflib_init()
  2) pm_init()

RETURN VALUE
  void - If setting to LPM Fails, not much the UIM can do about it.

SIDE EFFECTS
  After this function is executed, the VREG (R)UIM is allowed to get into
  LPM following the state of TCXO.

FUNCTION UIM_CMD_RSP_TIMER_EXPIRY_CB

DESCRIPTION
  This procedure is registered as a call-back associated with the expiry of
  the command response timer. This call-back is called in the context of the
  high priority timer task as soon as the rex timer for the work waiting time
  expires.

  The logic in this call-back is as follows:
    - (for LCU) check if the count in the rx fifo + the packing buffer increased
        from the last check.
          - If the count increased, then re-start the wwt timer.
          - else, put drivers uim_rx_state to IDLE, mask all interrupts, reset
            uart, set cmd_rsp_timeout signal and powerdown the sim interface

    - (for non-LCU) check if RXRDY bit is set in the status. If set,
        set cmd_rsp_timeout and return. If not set, put drivers uim-rx-state to
        idle, mask all interrupts, reset uart, set cmd_rsp_timeout signal and
        power down the sim interface.

  NOTE: The powerdown sequence of the UIM (as in the uim_power_down() function)
        is not started within this call-back as it is a huge-piece of logic
        which might hog the CPU as this call-back is being executed in the
        context of the timer task. Hence, this call-back only signals the
        UIM task to initiate the powerdown sequence, if needed.

DEPENDENCIES
  None

RETURN VALUE
  None

SIDE EFFECTS
  Power down of the SIM interface if the command response timeout expired.
