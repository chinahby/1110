  When options paramater is NULL, default ICM options are used to make the call.

  OriginateCall handles GSM CLIR suppression and invocation based on
  dialed digits. It also handles CDMA flash if there are other calls connected.

FUNCTION: ICM_CallOpsStringCheck

DESCRIPTION:
  Check if the dialed string is a call related operation which does
  not result in call origination.

  In some cases ICM_CallOpsRequest() need a call_id associated with the
  number that user dialed. For eg: the call_id assocated with X if
  user types 1 X <send>. call_num will contain the value X in this case
  after ICM_CallOpsStringCheck() is called.

  If display used by Application is different from the call_id provided
  by ICM, X should be mapped to the appropriate call_id before calling
  ICM_CallOpsRequest(). Otherwise, the call_num returned can be directly
  used in ICM_CallOpsRequest().

RETURN VALUE:

  AEECM_IS_CALLOPS_NEED_CALLID: If dialed string is a call related operation
                           and ICM_CallOpsRequest() need a call id.

  EFAILED:                 Otherwise

COMMENTS:

FUNCTION: OEMCM_SetSystemPreference

DESCRIPTION:
  Change the phone's system selection preference (mode, band, and

                        AEECallback *status_cb)

PARAMETERS:
  po                [in]: ICM interface pointer.
  mode_pref         [in]: Preferred mode
  pref_term         [in]: Preference span
  pref_duration     [in]: Indicates duration in seconds for pref term
  acq_order_pref    [in]: GW acquisition order preference
  band_pref         [in]: Band preference
  roam_pref         [in]: Roam preference
  hybr_pref         [in]: Hybrid Preference
  srv_domain_pref   [in]: Service domain preference
  nw_sel_mode_pref  [in]: Network should be selected automatically or manually
  plmn_ptr          [in]: If network selection is set to manual,
                          this specifies PLMN ID
  wlan_ptr          [in]: WLAN preference
  status_cb         [in]: Status Callback

RETURN VALUE:
  AEE_SUCCESS:  If procedure was started correctly.
  EFAILED:      Otherwise.

COMMENTS:
  If status_cb is registered, asynchronous result of the function from lower
  layers is provided to the application. The function always returns
  immediately without waiting for the result from lower layers irrespective of
  whether status_cb is used or not.

FUNCTION: OEMCM_SendMBMSCommand

DESCRIPTION:
  Sends a command to the MBMS Service Manager.
  Clients should fill in the appropriate MBMS request type and also
  provide the corresponding parameters in the mbms_generic_req struct.

  Aysynchronous command responses will be sent to the application
  via notify events.  Apps that wish to receive MBMS related events
  must register with ICM notifier to receive events with the mask
  NMASK_CM_MBMS.  Eg:
  ISHELL_RegisterNotify(pIShell, AEECLSID_SOMEAPP, AEECLSID_CM_NOTIFIER, NMASK_CM_MBMS)

  Event specific data will accompany the event in the dwParam->data within a structure of
  type AEECMNotifyInfo.event_data.mbms.  See AEECMMBMSEventData to see the specific event
  types and data that can be received related to MBMS.

PARAMETERS:
  pMe                [in]: ICM interface pointer.
