FUNCTION: AEEClsCreateInstance

DESCRIPTION
  This function is invoked while the app is being loaded. All Modules must provide this 
  function. Ensure to retain the same name and parameters for this function.
  In here, the module must verify the ClassID and then invoke the AEEApplet_New() function
  that has been provided in AEEAppGen.c. 

   After invoking AEEApplet_New(), this function can do app specific initialization. In this
   example, a generic structure is provided so that app developers need not change app specific
   initialization section every time except for a call to IDisplay_InitAppData(). 
   This is done as follows: InitAppData() is called to initialize AppletData 
   instance. It is app developers responsibility to fill-in app data initialization 
   code of InitAppData(). App developer is also responsible to release memory 
   allocated for data contained in AppletData -- this can be done in 
   IDisplay_FreeAppData().

PROTOTYPE:
   int AEEClsCreateInstance(AEECLSID ClsId,IShell * pIShell,IModule * po,void ** ppObj)

PARAMETERS:
  clsID: [in]: Specifies the ClassID of the applet which is being loaded

  pIShell: [in]: Contains pointer to the IShell object. 

  pIModule: pin]: Contains pointer to the IModule object to the current module to which
  this app belongs

  ppObj: [out]: On return, *ppObj must point to a valid IApplet structure. Allocation
  of memory for this structure and initializing the base data members is done by AEEApplet_New().

DEPENDENCIES
  none

RETURN VALUE
  AEE_SUCCESS: If the app needs to be loaded and if AEEApplet_New() invocation was
     successful
  EFAILED: If the app does not need to be loaded or if errors occurred in 
     AEEApplet_New(). If this function returns FALSE, the app will not be loaded.

SIDE EFFECTS
  none

DESCRIPTION
  This is the EventHandler for this app. All events to this app are handled in this
  function. All APPs must supply an Event Handler.

PROTOTYPE:
  boolean BTApp_HandleEvent(IApplet *pi, AEEEvent eCode, uint16 wParam, uint32 dwParam)

PARAMETERS:
  pi: Pointer to the AEEApplet structure. This structure contains information specific
  to this applet. It was initialized during the AEEClsCreateInstance() function.

  ecode: Specifies the Event sent to this applet

  wParam, dwParam: Event specific data.

DEPENDENCIES
  none

RETURN VALUE
  TRUE: If the app has processed the event
  FALSE: If the app did not process the event

SIDE EFFECTS
  none
