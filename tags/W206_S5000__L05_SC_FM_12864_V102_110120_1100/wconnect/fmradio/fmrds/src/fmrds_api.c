 FM-RDS API Level Code
 ---------------------
 
 DESCRIPTION

 Messages into FM-RDS task are processed here. Operation is based around
 an FM task that must be incorporated into the task list with an appropriate 
 priority.

 Higher-level code must first register with FM services as a client. 
 Subsequently, FM-related commands are passed from the Apps layer into an FM 
 command queue, for subsequent service by the FM task. Depending on function, 
 commands are actioned immediately and a response sent to the caller or, in the 
 case of actions involving some delay, pending command status is returned and 
 the command outcome returned some time later as an event.

 Event notification is asynchronous and is notified to the client by means of a 
 previously-registered callback function.

 This file contains support code for 3rd-party FM devices.

FUNCTION		FmrdsApi_RegisterClient

DESCRIPTION     
 This is a direct command used to register for event notification. 
 The client/application layer can pass a pointer to callback function which 
 will be used for asynchronous event notification. A numeric client ID will be 
 returned, where a non-zero value indicates successful registration 
 (Client_id == 0 indicates a registration error). 

 The parameter fmrds_cb_ptr must be a non-NULL value.  If a NULL value is 
 passed to this function, the registration will fail and a zero client id will 
 be returned. Similarly, if the total number of clients supported by the 
 FM-stack is exceeded, registration will fail and a zero client id will be 
 returned.

 Registration also passes an event mask to enable selective notification of
 fm-related events - not currently implemented.

DEPENDENCIES    None.

PARAMETERS		
 o	pfnFmrdsEvCbFn  - callback function pointer
 o  fmCbEvMask      - event mask

 Callback function provided by the client/application layer, which will be used
 by the FM-Stack to deliver event notifications.

FUNCTION		FmrdsApi_DeRegisterClient

DESCRIPTION     
 This is a direct command used to deregister the callback for event 
 notification. The client/application layer can pass its registered client id 
 which will be used to deregister asynchronous event notification for that 
 client. 

 The parameter fmrds_client_id should be the client id returned from 
 FmrdsApi_RegisterClient.  Passing an invalid client id will result in no 
 clients being de-registered. 

DEPENDENCIES    None.

PARAMETERS		
 o	ucFmrdsClientId

 Client ID returned from a successful call to fmrds_api_register_client. 
 The command is issued directly to the FM stack. This command does not result 
 in a command being placed on the command queue, or any direct communication 
 with the FM-RDS device.

FUNCTION		FmrdsApi_EnableFm

DESCRIPTION     
 This is an indirect command used to power on the FM-RDS hardware, initialize 
 it with default settings, and place it into a low power mode ready for further 
 commands.

 Although the device will be powered on, the FM-RDS device will be placed in 
 the RADIO_MODE_OFF mode to ensure that the device is consuming the least 
 amount of current possible.  It is the client's responsibility to switch the 
 device to the desired operating mode via the fmrds_api_set_radio_mode function.

DEPENDENCIES    None.

PARAMETERS

         "	RDS_OFF
         "	RDS_MODE
         "	RBDS_MODE

 The command is issued indirectly to the FM-RDS device. Initially, command data 
 is packaged into an FMRDS_ENABLE_FM command in the FM-RDS command queue. The 
 queue will return a PENDING status immediately if the message is passed 
 successfully; otherwise, the respective error code is returned. This is to 
 prevent unnecessary blocking from the calling process. 

 When ready, the fmrds_task will pull this message from its command queue and 
 initialize the FM-RDS device with the default/sane settings. On completion, an 
 FMRDS_EV_ENABLE_FM event and associated event message is returned 
 asynchronously to the application layer. This event will return information 
 about the FM-RDS device. In this case, it is returned via a callback mechanism 
 to the FM-RDS BREW OEM layer. This API should only be called after successful 
 registration via fmrds_api_register_client.

FUNCTION		FmrdsApi_SetStation

DESCRIPTION     

 This is an indirect command which tunes the FM-RDS device to a station on the 
 supplied frequency. Only valid frequencies within the band set by 
 FmrdsApi_EnableFm can be tuned by this function.  Attempting to tune to 
 frequencies outside of this band will result in an error.

DEPENDENCIES    None.

PARAMETERS		
 o	usFmrdsFreq
    o The desired frequency to be tuned. This frequency will be in 0.01MHz steps, 
      giving a valid range of 8750 - 10800 for US/Europe, and 7600 - 9100 for Japan 
      bands.  This frequency might be rounded to the closest frequency supported by 
      the FM-RDS device.

 This function can be used in RADIO_MODE_RX, RADIO_MODE_TX, and 
 RADIO_MODE_TX_RX modes.

 The command is issued indirectly to the FM-RDS device. Initially, command data 
 is packaged into an FMRDS_SET_RADIO_STATION command in the FM-RDS command queue. The 
 queue will return a PENDING status immediately if the message is passed 
 successfully; otherwise, the respective error code is returned. This is to 
 prevent unnecessary blocking from the calling process. 

 When ready, the fmrds_task will pull this message from its command queue and 
 instruct the FM-RDS device to tune to the supplied frequency. On completion, 
 a FMRDS_EV_RADIO_STATION_SET event and associated event message is returned 
 asynchronously to the application layer. Additionally, one the specified 
 station is successfully tuned by the FM-RDS device, a 
 FMRDS_EV_RADIO_TUNE_STATUS event will be returned to the client/application 
 layer. In this case, it is returned via a callback mechanism to the FM-RDS 
 BREW OEM layer. This API should only be called after successful registration 
 and initialization is completed.

FUNCTION		FmrdsApi_SearchStations

DESCRIPTION     

 This is an indirect command used to seek or scan for stations which have a 
 relatively strong signal.

DEPENDENCIES    None.

PARAMETERS		
 "	search_mode - One of the following search modes:
    o	SEARCHMODE_SEEK ' Searches for next valid station
    o	SEARCHMODE_SCAN ' Searches for next valid station and dwells for a 
        specific period of time before searching to the next station
 "	search_up_down - Search direction (Up/Down)
    o	SEARCHDIR_UP ' increment by next channel spacing 
    o	SEARCHDIR_DOWN ' decrement by next channel spacing
 "	scan_time - Scan dwell time in seconds (only valid for	SEARCHMODE_SCAN)
 "	srchRssiLev - RSSI Level for the search operation (i.e. some predefined 
    values:SEARCH_RSSI_LEVEL_WEAK,SEARCH_RSSI_LEVEL_MID,SEARCH_RSSI_LEVEL_STRONG)

 This command is used to invoke a basic seek/scan of the FM radio band. The 
 most basic operation performed by this function is a SEARCHMODE_SEEK command. 
 The seek process is handled by incrementally setting the frequency in 
 pre-defined channel steps and measuring the resulting signal level. Once a 
 station with a reasonably strong signal level is found, and successfully 
 tuned, the seek operation will be completed and a FMRDS_EV_SEARCH_COMPLETE 
 event will be returned to the client.  If no stations are found to match the 
 search criteria, the frequency will be returned to the originally tuned 
 station.   

 Since a seek always results in a frequency being tuned, each seek operation 
 will also return a single FMRDS_EV_RADIO_TUNE_STATUS event to the 
 client/application layer.

 Much like SEARCHMODE_SEEK, a SEARCHMODE_SCAN command can be likened to many 
 back to back seeks with a dwell period after each successful seek.  Once 
 issued, a scan will either increment or decrement frequencies until a 
 relatively strong station is found.  Once this station is found, and is 
 successfully tuned, a FMRDS_EV_RADIO_TUNE_STATUS event will be returned to 
 the client and the station will remain tuned for the specific period of time 
 indicated by scan_time.  After that time expires, a FMRDS_EV_SCAN_IN_PROGRESS 
 event will be sent to the client and a new search will begin for the next 
 relatively strong station. After scanning the entire band, or after a cancel 
 search has been initiated by the client, a FMRDS_EV_SEARCH_COMPLETE event will 
 be sent to the client.

 Once issuing a search command, several commands from the client may be 
 disallowed until the search is completed or canceled. A current list of 
 disallowed commands can be found in section TBD.  

 The command is issued indirectly to the FM-RDS device. Initially, command data 
 is packaged into an FMRDS_SEARCH_STATIONS command in the FM-RDS command queue. 
 The queue will return a PENDING status immediately if the message is passed 
 successfully; otherwise, the respective error code is returned. This is to 
 prevent unnecessary blocking from the calling process. 

 When ready, the fmrds_task will pull this message from its command queue and 
 invoke the search operation through the relevant generic driver layer command. 
 On completion of the search, FMRDS_EV_SEARCH_COMPLETE and 
 FMRDS_EV_RADIO_TUNE_STATUS events and their associated event messages will be 
 returned asynchronously to the application layer. For the seek operation it 
 returns the tuned station. In this case, it is returned via a callback 
 mechanism to the FM-RDS BREW OEM layer. This API should only be called after 
 successful registration, connection, and initialization is completed.

 The search can be canceled at any time by using API FmrdsApi_CancelSearch( ).

FUNCTION		FmrdsApi_RdsSearchStations

DESCRIPTION     

 This API is used to search stations using RDS:
   - Invokes seek based on program type
   - Invokes scan based on program type with specified dwell period 
   - Invokes seek based on program identification 
   - Invokes seek for alternate frequency

DEPENDENCIES    None.

PARAMETERS		
 "	rds_search_mode - One of the following RDS search modes:
    o	SEARCHMODE_RDS_SEEK_PTY ' Searches for next valid station that is 
        broadcasting the specified program type (PTY)
    o	SEARCHMODE_RDS_SCAN_PTY ' Similar to Seek PTY except dwells on valid 
        station before searching next
    o	SEARCHMODE_RDS_SEEK_PI ' Searches for next valid station that is 
        broadcasting the specified program ID
    o	SEARCHMODE_RDS_SEEK_AF ' Searches next valid station for alternate 
        frequency
 "	search_up_down - Search direction (Up/Down)
 "	scan_time - Scan dwell time in seconds (only valid for	SEARCHMODE_SCAN 
    and	SEARCHMODE_RDS_SCAN_PTY)
 "	search_pty - Program Type to search for (only valid for 
    SEARCHMODE_RDS_SEEK_PTY)
 "	search_pi - Program ID to search for (only valid for SEARCHMODE_RDS_SEEK_PI)
 "	srchRssiLev - RSSI Level for the search operation (i.e. some predefined 
    values:SEARCH_RSSI_LEVEL_WEAK,SEARCH_RSSI_LEVEL_MID,SEARCH_RSSI_LEVEL_STRONG)

 This function allows the client to issue seeks and scans similar to commands 
 found in fmrds_api_search_stations. However, each command has an additional 
 RDS component which must be satisfied before a station is successfully tuned. 
 Please see fmrds_api_search_stations for an understanding of how seeks and 
 scans work.

 Much like SEARCHMODE_SEEK in fmrds_api_search_stations, 
 SEARCHMODE_RDS_SEEK_PTY allows the client to seek to stations which are 
 broadcasting RDS data with a program type that matches search_pty. The 
 behavior and events generated for a SEARCHMODE_RDS_SEEK_PTY exactly match the 
 behavior of SEARCHMODE_SEEK, yet only stations broadcasting the specified RDS 
 Program Type (PTY) will be found.  If no matching stations can be found, the 
 original station will be restored.

 Just as SEARCHMODE_RDS_SEEK_PTY's functionality matches SEARCHMODE_SEEK, so 
 does SEARCHMODE_RDS_SCAN_PTY match SEARCHMODE_SCAN. The only difference 
 between the two is that only stations broadcasting a RDS Program Type (PTY) 
 matching search_pty are found and tuned when using SEARCHMODE_RDS_SCAN_PTY.  
 If no station is found to have the PTY as specified by search_pty, then the 
 original station will be restored.

 SEARCHMODE_RDS_SEEK_PI is used the same way as SEARCHMODE_RDS_SEEK_PTY, but 
 only stations matching the specified PI are found.  

 Lastly, SEARCHMODE_RDS_SEEK_AF's functionality differs slightly compared to 
 the other commands in this function.  This command only seeks to stations 
 which are known ahead of time to be alternate frequencies for the currently 
 tune station.  If no alternate frequencies are known, or if the alternate 
 frequencies have a weaker signal strength than the original frequency, the 
 original frequency will be restored.

 Once issuing a search command, several commands from the client may be 
 disallowed until the search is completed or canceled. A current list of 
 disallowed commands can be found in section TBD.  

 The command is issued indirectly to the FM-RDS device. Initially, command 
 data is packaged into an FMRDS_SEARCH_STATIONS command in the FM-RDS command 
 queue. The queue will return a PENDING status immediately if the message is 
 passed successfully; otherwise, the respective error code is returned. This 
 is to prevent unnecessary blocking from the calling process. 

 When ready, the fmrds_task will pull this message from its command queue and 
 invoke the scan operation through the relevant generic driver layer command. 
 On completion of the search, an FMRDS_EV_SEARCH_COMPLETE event and associated 
 event message is returned asynchronously to the application layer. For the 
 seek operation it returns the tuned station. In this case, it is returned via 
 a callback mechanism to the FM-RDS BREW OEM layer. This API should only be 
 called after successful registration, connection, and initialization is 
 completed.

 The search can be canceled at any time by using API FmrdsApi_CancelSearch( ).

FUNCTION		FmrdsApi_SearchStationList

DESCRIPTION     

 This API is used to search station list; i.e. generates a list of frequencies, 
 RDS capability, etc for each valid station.
   - Invokes search for strong stations.
   - Invokes search for weak stations.
   - Invokes search for strongest stations.
   - Invokes search for weakest stations. 
   - Invokes search based on program type.

DEPENDENCIES    None.

   o STATIONLIST_STRONGEST  Searches entire band for strongest stations 
     (confined by Search_list_max)
   o STATIONLIST_WEAKEST  Searches entire band for weakest (lowest signal 
     strength) stations (confined by Search_list_max)
   o STATIONLIST_PTY  Searches the band and generates a station list based on 
     matching PTY (confined by Search_list_max)
 "	Search_list_max  The maximum number of stations to be returned (0 for 
    unlimited).
 "	search_up_down - Search direction (Up/Down)

 "	srchRssiLev - RSSI Level for the search operation (i.e. some predefined 
    values:SEARCH_RSSI_LEVEL_WEAK,SEARCH_RSSI_LEVEL_MID,SEARCH_RSSI_LEVEL_STRONG)

 This command is used to invoke a search of the FM radio band. The range of 
 frequencies scanned also depends on the band set (see section TBD); otherwise, 
 it is default to the Europe/U.S settings of 87.5 MHz to 108 MHz. The driver 
 searches for all valid stations in the band and when complete, returns a 
 channel list. The scan process is handled by incrementally setting the station 
 in pre-defined channel steps and measuring the resulting level and signal 
 parameters. On completion or canceling of the search, the originally tuned 
 station will be restored and a FMRDS_EV_RADIO_TUNE_STATUS event will be 
 generated.

 Search for strongest or weakest station will generate number of stations as 
 supported by the specific target. 

 Once issuing a search command, several commands from the client may be 
 disallowed until the search is completed or canceled. A current list of 
 disallowed commands can be found in section TBD.  

 The command is issued indirectly to the FM-RDS device. Initially, command data 
 is packaged into an FMRDS_SEARCH_STATION_LIST command in the FM-RDS command 
 queue. The queue will return a PENDING status immediately if the message is 
 passed successfully; otherwise, the respective error code is returned. This is 
 to prevent unnecessary blocking from the calling process.

 When ready, the fmrds_task will pull this message from its command queue and 
 invoke the search operation through the relevant generic driver layer command. 
 On completion of the search, an FMRDS_EV_SEARCH_LIST_COMPLETE event and 
 associated event message is returned asynchronously to the application layer. 
 In this case, it is returned via a callback mechanism to the FM-RDS BREW OEM 
 layer. This API should only be called after successful registration, 
 connection, and initialization is completed.

 The return event will list all the frequencies with matching criteria and if 
 RDS is received on these frequencies.

 NOTE: When the search is started, it starts from the currently tuned frequency 
 and returns to the original frequency on completion.

 The Scan can be canceled at any time by using API fmrds_api_cancel_search (). 
 An event FMRDS_EV_SEARCH_CANCELED is called with the partial list of channels 
 for the search period as per the search criteria (if available).

FUNCTION		FmrdsApi_SetRdsRxProcessingOptions

DESCRIPTION     

 This function sets RDS Rx processing options.  Included in these options is 
 the ability for the client/application layer to select what "raw" RDS groups 
 should be passed to the client.
 
 Once a group is enabled, and when a buffer holding those groups reaches the
 threshold defined by en_rds_buffer_size, a FMRDS_EV_RAW_RDS_RBDS_DATA event
 will be sent to the client.  This event will contain all groups currently held
 in this buffer, and there will be no need for the client to request the groups
 later.

 Alternatively, if the flag rdsReturnRawBlocks is set, raw rds block data will
 be collected until the specified buffer is full. A FMRDS_EV_RAW_RDS_RBDS_BLOCK_DATA
 event will then be returned instead of FMRDS_EV_RAW_RDS_RBDS_DATA. This enables
 raw block/group data to be decoded externally, to support legacy functionality.
 Only error-free block/group data will be returned.

DEPENDENCIES    None.

 This function is used by the client/application layer to register and 
 deregister for extended FM-RDS Rx event processing. As of now, the FM-stack 
 supports program service, radio text, and alternate frequency list 
 processing. Only one client is supported. 

 The result of registered RDS processing will be returned to the 
 client/application layer in the form of multiple events.  Included in these 
 events will be the status information for program service name, radio text, 
 and alternate frequency list processing.

 The command is issued indirectly to the FM-RDS device. Initially, command data 
 is packaged into an FMRDS_REG_RDS_RX_GRPS_PROCESSINGcommand in the FM-RDS 
 command queue. The queue will return a PENDING status immediately if the 
 message is passed successfully; otherwise, the respective error code is 
 returned. This is to prevent unnecessary blocking from the calling process. 

 When ready, the fmrds_task will pull this message from its command queue and 
 invoke the operation to set RDS Rx Configuration registers through the 
 relevant generic driver layer command. On completion, an 
 FMRDS_EV_RDS_RX_GRPS_REG_DONE event and associated event message is returned 
 asynchronously to the application layer. In this case, it is returned via a 
 callback mechanism to the FM-RDS BREW OEM layer. This API should only be 
 called after successful registration, connection, and initialization is 
 completed.

 When Program Service (PS) information becomes available, a 
 FMRDS_EV_RDS_PS_INFO event and PS information will be sent to the client.

FUNCTION		FmrdsApi_TxPSStationInfo

DESCRIPTION     

 This function will continuously transmit RDS Program Service information over 
 a tuned frequency.

DEPENDENCIES    None.

PARAMETERS		
 o	fmrdsTxPSStationInfoOpts
    o A single null-terminated character string to be parsed and transmitted as 
      one or more 8-character strings.
    o fmrds_tx_ps_rpt_cnt
    o The number of times each 8-character string will be repeated before 
      transmitting the next string.
    o fmrds_tx_ps_pty
    o The Program Type code (PTY) which will be transmitted along with the 
      Program Service information.
    o fmrds_tx_af_list
    o A pointer to a structure holding the number of alternate frequencies to 
      transmit and that list of alternate frequencies.  If no alternate 
      frequencies should be transmitted, pass a NULL for this parameter.

 This function is used by the client to transmit RDS Program Service 
 information on an already tuned frequency.  The Program Service information 
 is made up of one or more 8-character strings, a Program Type (PTY), an 
 Alternate Frequency (AF) and also a Program Identification (PI).   This 
 information is eventually used to generate 0A and/or 0B RDS groups to be 
 transmitted on a tuned station.

 The one or more 8-character strings are created from the passed 
 fmrds_tx_ps_string string, which is parsed into a new string after every 
 8 characters.  If the final string consists of less than 8 characters, the 
 remaining characters will be filled with "blank" space characters.  Each 
 8-character string will be repeated zero or more times before the next 
 Program Service string is transmitted.  Once all Program Service strings have 
 been transmitted, the process will start over from the first string again.  

 The Program Service information will be continuously transmitted until the 
 client stops or starts another Program Service transmission, or if the FM-RDS 
 device is no longer in TX mode and tuned to a frequency.  Each call to 
 transmit Program Service information will replace all previously set Program 
 Service information.

 Since the PI is not set through this function, it is recommended that 
 fmrds_api_tx_set_station_pi is called before executing this function.  If the 
 PI is not set, a default PI will be used instead.  

 The command is issued indirectly to the FM-RDS device. Initially, command data 
 is packaged into an FMRDS_TX_PS_INFO command in the FM-RDS command queue. The 
 queue will return a PENDING status immediately if the message is passed 
 successfully; otherwise, the respective error code is returned. This is to 
 prevent unnecessary blocking from the calling process. 

 When ready, the fmrds_task will pull this message from its command queue and 
 invoke the operation to send the Program Service information to the FM-RDS 
 device and start Program Service transmission through the relevant generic 
 driver layer command. On completion, an FMRDS_EV_TX_PS_INFO_COMPLETE event and 
 associated event message is returned asynchronously to the application layer.

 This function will transmit one or more RDS groups once over a tuned

DEPENDENCIES    None.

PARAMETERS		
 o	fmrdsTxOneShotRdsGrpsOpts
    o A pointer to a buffer of one or more RDS groups to transmit.
    o fmrds_tx_num_rds_groups_to_tx.
    o The number of RDS groups to be copied and transmitted from 
      fmrds_tx_rds_groups.
    o fmrds_tx_num_rds_groups_processed.
    o The number of RDS groups actually copied from fmrds_tx_rds_groups.

 This function is used by the client to transmit one or more RDS groups, only 
 once, on an already tuned frequency.  Since block A of each RDS group consists 
 only of a Program Identification code (PI) and a checkword, this block is 
 removed from the tfmrds_tx_rds_group_type type.   Each RDS group passed into 
 this function should consist only of blocks BCD, and block A will be 
 automatically generated from the PI set from fmrds_api_tx_set_station_pi. 
 If no PI has been set by the client, a default PI will be used to generate 
 block A for each group.  

 Each call to this function will store the passed RDS groups into one or more 
 local buffers before they are passed to the FM-RDS device. Each local buffer 
 can store one or more RDS groups before they are passed to the FM-RDS device. 
 Once the client begins RDS group transmission, the FM-stack will issue an 
 event to the client whenever there is at least one RDS group buffer empty. 
 If the client has more groups to transmit than there is room in the buffers, 
 the client can use fmrds_api_tx_get_rds_groups_buf to determine when there is 
 sufficient room for additional groups.  

 Once an RDS group buffer becomes empty, the stack will alert the client that 
 more groups can be added via a FMRDS_EV_TX_RDS_GROUPS_COMPLETE event.  Because 
 the stack will only issue this event when a buffer becomes empty, multiple 
 calls to this function might result in only one 
 FMRDS_EV_TX_RDS_GROUPS_COMPLETE event being generated.

 Since switching between transmitting "one-shot" and continuous RDS groups can 
 lead to unexpected behavior, transitioning between "one-shot" and continuous 
 RDS transmission, and vice versa, will lead to all un-transmitted groups 
 being cleared. 

 The command is issued indirectly to the FM-RDS device. Initially, command data 
 is packaged into an FMRDS_TX_RDS_GROUPS command in the FM-RDS command queue. 
 The queue will return a PENDING status immediately if the message is passed 
 successfully; otherwise, the respective error code is returned. This is to 
 prevent unnecessary blocking from the calling process. 

 When ready, the fmrds_task will pull this message from its command queue and 
 invoke the operation to send RDS groups to the FM-RDS device and start 
 one-shot RDS group transmission through the relevant generic driver layer 
 command. On completion, an FMRDS_EV_TX_RDS_GROUPS_COMPLETE event and 
 associated event message is returned asynchronously to the application layer.

    o A pointer to a buffer of one or more RDS groups to transmit.
    o fmrds_tx_num_rds_groups_to_tx.
    o The number of RDS groups to be copied and transmitted from 
      fmrds_tx_rds_groups.
    o fmrds_tx_num_rds_groups_processed.
    o The number of RDS groups actually copied from fmrds_tx_rds_groups.

 This function is used by the client to transmit one or more RDS groups, 
 continuously, on an already tuned frequency.  Since block A of each RDS group 
 consists only of a Program Identification code (PI) and a checkword, this 
 block is removed from the tfmrds_tx_rds_group_type type.   Each RDS group 
 passed into this function should consist only of blocks BCD, and block A will 
 be automatically generated from the PI set from fmrds_api_tx_set_station_pi. 
 If no PI has been set by the client, a default PI will be used to generate 
 block A for each group.  

 Unlike "One-Shot" RDS group transmission, continuous group transmission will 
 repeatedly transmit all RDS groups stored in an RDS group buffer until stopped 
 by the client.  Additionally, continuous RDS group transmission must consist 
 of only a single static RDS group buffer.  This buffer can consist of one or 
 more RDS groups, but the RDS group buffer is cleared each time this function 
 is called. Each call of this function will store the passed RDS groups into a 
 local buffer before it is passed to the FM-RDS device. 

 Since continuous RDS group transmission works on a static RDS buffer, the 
 number of groups in the buffer will not change as groups are transmitted. 

 The command is issued indirectly to the FM-RDS device. Initially, command data 
 is packaged into an FMRDS_TX_CONT_RDS_GROUPS command in the FM-RDS command 
 queue. The queue will return a PENDING status immediately if the message is 
 passed successfully; otherwise, the respective error code is returned. This is 
 to prevent unnecessary blocking from the calling process. 

 When ready, the fmrds_task will pull this message from its command queue and 
 invoke the operation to send RDS groups to the FM-RDS device and start 
 continuous RDS group transmission through the relevant generic driver layer 
 command. On completion, an FMRDS_EV_TX_CONT_RDS_GROUPS_COMPLETE event and 
 associated event message is returned asynchronously to the application layer.

FUNCTION		FmrdsApi_TxRdsGroupCtrl

DESCRIPTION     

 This function is used to pause or resume RDS group transmission, or stop and 
 clear all RDS groups.

DEPENDENCIES    None.

PARAMETERS		

 o	fmrdsTxRdsGrpCtrlOpt - used to pause, stop and clear, or resume RDS 
    group transmission.
     o FMRDS_TX_RDS_GROUP_PAUSE - pauses RDS group transmission.
     o FMRDS_TX_RDS_GROUP_CLEAR - stops RDS group transmission and clears all 
       stored groups.
     o FMRDS_TX_RDS_GROUP_RESUME - resumes a paused RDS group transmission.

 This function can be used to pause RDS group transmission, as well as resume 
 RDS group transmission. Additionally, this function can also be used to stop 
 RDS group transmission and clear previously stored RDS groups.
 
 If the client calls this function with fmrds_tx_rds_group_ctrl set to 
 FMRDS_TX_RDS_GROUP_PAUSE, this function will stop RDS group transmission 
 started by fmrds_api_tx_rds_groups and  fmrds_api_tx_cont_rds_groups. 
 Although RDS group transmission will be stopped, all stored RDS group data 
 will remain intact.  Once paused, RDS group transmission can be resumed by 
 calling fmrds_api_tx_rds_group_ctrl again with fmrds_tx_rds_group_ctrl set to 
 FMRDS_TX_RDS_GROUP_RESUME.  Resuming RDS transmission will restart RDS 
 transmission after the last transmitted group.

 If this function is called with fmrds_tx_rds_group_ctrl set to 
 FMRDS_TX_RDS_GROUP_CLEAR, all previously stored RDS groups will be cleared 
 and RDS group transmission will be stopped.  

 The command is issued indirectly to the FM-RDS device. Initially, command data 
 is packaged into an FMRDS_TX_RDS_GROUP_CTRL command in the FM-RDS command 
 queue. The queue will return a PENDING status immediately if the message is 
 passed successfully; otherwise, the respective error code is returned. This is 
 to prevent unnecessary blocking from the calling process. 

 When ready, the fmrds_task will pull this message from its command queue and 
 invoke the operation to pause, resume or clear RDS group transmission through 
 the relevant generic driver layer command. On completion, an 
 FMRDS_EV_TX_RDS_GROUP_CTRL_COMPLETE event and associated event message is 
 returned asynchronously to the application layer.

   This function is used by the client/application layer to register and 
   deregister for RTPlus class processing. The result of registered RDS 
   processing will be returned to the client/application layer in the form of 
   multiple events.  

   The command is issued indirectly to the FM-RDS device. Initially, command 
   data is packaged into an FMRDS_REG_RX_RTPLUS_CLS_PROCESSING command in the 
   FM-RDS command queue. The queue will return a PENDING status immediately if 
   the message is passed successfully; otherwise, the respective error code is 
   returned. This is to prevent unnecessary blocking from the calling process. 

   When ready, the fmrds_task will pull this message from its command queue and 
   invoke the operation to set 2A/B, 3A and all ODA A group processing 
   through the relevant generic driver layer command. On completion, an 
   FMRDS_EV_RX_RTPLUS_CLS_REG_DONE event and associated event message is 
   returned asynchronously to the application layer. In this case, it is 
   returned via a callback mechanism to the FM-RDS BREW OEM layer. This API 
   should only be called after successful registration, connection, and 
   initialization is completed.

   When RTPlus information becomes available, a FMRDS_EV_RTPLUSE_INFO event and 
   RTPlus class information will be sent to the client.

FUNCTION		FmrdsApi_TxGetRdsGroupsBufSize

DESCRIPTION     

 This function will continuously transmit RDS RTPlus information over a tuned 
 frequency.

DEPENDENCIES    None.

PARAMETERS		
 fmrds_tx_rt_string
   A single 65 character or less, null-terminated character string to be 
   transmitted as Radio Text.

 fmrds_tx_rt_pty
   The Program Type code (PTY) which will be transmitted along with the Radio 
   Text information

 tsFmrdsRTPlusTagsType fmrdsRTplusTags[2]
   teFmrdsRTPlusClasstType rtPlusContType;
       RT Content Type
   uint8 startMarker;
       Start Marker pointing to the position (inside the RT message) of the 
      first character of that RTplus information element
   uint8 lenMarker;
       Length Marker indicating the length of that RTplus information element

 teFmrdsAppGrpTypeCode appGrpTypeCode;
 boolean newItem;
 boolean clearCmd;

 This function is used by the client to transmit RTPlus radio text information 
 on an already tuned frequency.  The RTplus information is made up of one 64 
 character or less string, PTY, PI and RTPlus tags.   This information is 
 eventually used to generate 2A and/or 2B, 3A and ODA type A RDS groups to be 
 transmitted on a tuned station.

 The RTPlus information will be continuously transmitted until the client stops 
 or starts another RTPlus/RT transmission, or if the FM-RDS device is no longer 
 in TX mode and tuned to a frequency.  Each call to transmit RTPlus information 
 will replace all previously set Radio Text/ RTPlus information.

 Since the PI is not set through this function, it is recommended that 
 fmrds_api_tx_set_station_pi is called before executing this function. If the 
 PI is not set, a default PI will be used instead  

 The command is issued indirectly to the FM-RDS device. Initially, command data 
 is packaged into an FMRDS_TX_RTPLUS_INFO command in the FM-RDS command queue. 
 The queue will return a PENDING status immediately if the message is passed 
 successfully; otherwise, the respective error code is returned. This is to 
 prevent unnecessary blocking from the calling process. 

 When ready, the fmrds_task will pull this message from its command queue and 
 invoke the operation to send the RTPlus information to the FM-RDS device and 
 start RTPlus transmission through the relevant generic driver layer command. 
 On completion, an FMRDS_EV_TX_ RTPlUS_INFO_COMPLETE event and associated event 
 message is returned asynchronously to the application layer.
