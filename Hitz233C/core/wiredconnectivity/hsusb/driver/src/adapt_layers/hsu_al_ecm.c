High Speed USB Ethernet Networking control Model (CDC/ECM) Adaptation Layer

GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Implementation of the High Speed USB CDC/ECM Adaptation Layer.
This includes implementation of the API functions defined by the CDC/ECM 
function driver in ecm_fd_api.h (such as callback functions), and the API 
exposed to the Applications (sio_usb like API).

EXTERNALIZED FUNCTIONS
hsu_al_ecm_config
hsu_al_ecm_control_open
hsu_al_ecm_data_open
hsu_al_ecm_control_close
hsu_al_ecm_data_close
hsu_al_ecm_control_transmit
hsu_al_ecm_data_transmit
hsu_al_ecm_ioctl
hsu_al_ecm_data_flush_tx
hsu_al_ecm_control_close
hsu_al_ecm_data_close

INITALIZATION AND SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS
The stack must be initialized first (which causes ecm_init to be called), 
before all other functions in this header file can be used.

FUNCTION      DEFER_CALL_TO_CDC_READ

DESCRIPTION   
Called in the AL Task's context.
Used when we need to call the stack's cdc_read API from an interrupt context 
(DMOV). In such cases, we enqueue a cmd to the AL task, and signal it. 
When the AL task gets the signal and handles the command, it calls this 
function, but from the AL task's context. Then, we can safely call the API
hsu_cdc_fd_api_cdc_read(), which locks the giant mutex and calls cdc_read().

Called in the AL Task's context.

FUNCTION      PERFORM_CONTROL_TRANSMIT

DESCRIPTION   
Called by either hsu_al_ecm_control_transmit() (application context) or by
hsu_al_ecm_encap_resp_comp_cb() (FD context), when it is allowed to  
send a DSM chain to the stack for transmission. 
When the function is called, the transmit buffer is already marked as full 
(the field ctrl_tx_num_of_bytes != 0), to ensure that further calls by the  
application to hsu_al_ecm_control_transmit() will cause the DSM chain to be 
enqueued to the control TX WM Q.

the function gathers the DSM chain into a preallocated buffer, and gives it to
the cdc_send_encap_response() function of the USB stack. 

The stack is responsible to generate a "response available" notification, and 
then send the message after the host sends an IN token on the control channel
following the notification. 

DEPENDENCIES  
ecm_init() and hsu_al_ecm_control_open() must have been called for this 
instance.
the control_info.write_buffer_data.ctrl_tx_num_of_bytes field must have 
been set to the DSM chain's length prior to the call to this function.

RETURN VALUE  
None.

SIDE EFFECTS  
None.

FUNCTION      HSU_AL_ECM_GET_FAKE_MAC_ADDR_AS_STR

DESCRIPTION   
Creates a fake MAC address. 

The real MAC address in the application is formulated based on information 
sent by the host on the control channel.

However, in ECM, the MAC address should be supplied for the descriptors, 
before there's a QMI link, and therefore we cannot use the same method.

Therefore it was decided that the ECM AL will "make up" a MAC address for the 
descriptors, but the host driver will ignore this address, and use the current
protocol to negotiate the MAC address that will be used for the session.

This will only  become an issue if we want to work with a standard ECM driver 
(either a Linux machine or a non-Qualcomm Windows driver).

FUNCTION      HSU_AL_ECM_CONTROL_TRANSMIT

DESCRIPTION   
Called by the application, when it wishes to send a message on the control
channel. The message is given as a chain of DSM items. 

The function gathers the DSM chain into a preallocated buffer, and gives it to
the cdc_send_encap_response() function of the USB stack. 

The stack is responsible to generate a "response available" notification, and 
then send the message after the host sends an IN token on the control channel
following the notification. 

Only one control message can be sent per instance at a time. 
Meaning, from the moment cdc_send_encap_response was called, and until the 
hsu_al_ecm_encap_resp_comp_cb was called, additional calls to 
cdc_send_encap_response() will fail!
therefore, additional calls to hsu_al_ecm_control_transmit cause the DSM chain
to be queued to the control TX WM Q.

DEPENDENCIES

FUNCTION      ENABLE_INBOUND_FLOW

DESCRIPTION   
This function performs the required operations for enabling inbound flow:
- Marks the flag 'inbound_flow_is_enabled' accordingly
- Sends a Connection Speed Changed notification to the host
- If there's a buffer waiting to be sent to the application, it calls the 
function handle_read_complete() with this buffer.
- If one of the 2 read buffers is idle, it gives it to the stack using the 
cdc_read() API.

Note: It is called from the application's context

DEPENDENCIES  
None.

RETURN VALUE  
None.

SIDE EFFECTS  
None.
